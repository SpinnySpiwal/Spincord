# Spincord
Welcome to the Official Spincord Repo!

## Status
ðŸ”´ *Closed* source until the code tidy-up code revision is completed.

##Â Spincord ETA
* Late August / Early September

## Features
* Biometrics (Can still fallback to passcode) authentication for your discord token. Enter once, authenticate always. This also comes with the added bonus: People can't go through your messages unless you authenticate!
* The first of it's kind to be shipped with voice chat. ~ Spincord Release 1 will be shipped **with** voice chat. You heard me.. With. Voice chat.
* One app, all your devices. You got an iPhone? Nice. Spincord works there. Oh your iPad? Even your MacBook Pro? Yes, it works on all of those devices. **One** home for all your discord messages.
* *zero* battery drain. Tired of discord running in the background and sipping your battery like it's sipping a cup of tea? Fear not, Spincord only runs when the app is open!
* Embeds ~ Embedded URL previews are already a thing in Spincord, no waiting for features you got used to in Discord's native app.
* Message Structures - Discord, Telegram & Whatsapp message structures. If you feel more at home with Whatsapp's message structure, because you want to be able to tell what you sent at a glance, you can do it with Spincord!

## *Special* benefits of the Spincord Voice Client.
Spincord, doesn't adhere to typical Discord bitrate limits. So your friends will always hear your voice as clear as day! 
Unlike the actual Discord client, which makes you *pay* for full bitrate.

## Idea(s) I have:
* A Spincord E2E toggle. Spincord could have a special feature where messages could be end-to-end encrypted for things like group chats or friends dms. and every chat could require a special pin to view. To prevent people stealing your device and viewing your secret messages. STATUS: Idea.

If you have an idea for a Spincord feature, contact me on Discord:

And we can talk about it.
